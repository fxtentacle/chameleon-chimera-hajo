  all loading features are implemented in base class PreferencesControllerBase,
  with the automatic parser engine.

	"/",
	"/Extra/",
	"/Volumes/EFI/Extra/",
	"/Volumes/Cham/Extra/",
	"/Volumes/BootLoaders/Extra/",
	"/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/",
- Change the restart by replacing the internal reboot shell cmd by an applescript 
  eq. to the AppleMenu/Restart command
- Fixed nib file loading and initialization problem, possibly fixes the lock pb as well?
