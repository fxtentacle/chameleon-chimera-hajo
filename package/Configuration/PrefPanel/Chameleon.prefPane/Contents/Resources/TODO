Future version (codename: Gandalf) Plans
----------------------------------------
Implement most if not all of the Chameleon bootConfig parameters in the table view of the current prefpane : let the Magic happening !

Current versions todo list
--------------------------
 - Add WebView in About Panel for nicer Kredits.
 - Don't filter out soft-raids, which only have a disk identifier & no partition number
 - Try to investigate if there is a better way to get the partition list
   (currently done with diskutil list) probably with Chameleon booter RC6.
