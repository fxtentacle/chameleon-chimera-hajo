Chameleon System Preferences panel

How to Install:
  Double click on the panel file to install the resource

Configuration:
  The persistent configuration file is a all users level preferences property list
  located in In /Library/Preferences/com.chameleon.prefPane.plist.

  The swap disk fix option might be use if your disk order from chameleon is different 
  from what  diskutil list returns.
  Ideally we should not need this fix, but as for now, I don't know another way to do it

  In /Library/Preferences/com.chameleon.prefPane.plist:
  you can insert a 'forceBootConfigPath' key with your com.apple.Boot,plist file path:
  So if automatic detection does not work, then force your com.apple.Boot.plist path here.
  
  Freeze Partitions (lock the partition list and prevent autodetection to happen)
  You can also decide to freeze the partitions to prevent automatic detection,
  if disk order is not matching after the boot or if you don't want the list to change
  each time that a usb key is inserted, then use this feature.
  For it to work, you will need first to click on:
    Settings/Boot Selector Fixes/Inject Parts In Freeze File
  Then all your automatically detected current partitions are injected in the pref. file,
  all you need to do is to manually edit them to change their disk id/partition id 
  (2 first parameters in the pref. file under the partitionList key)

Troubleshooting
  If the panel sees your com.apple.boot.plist in the status box, but the boot selection 
  seem to have no effect, it might be that you have more than one bootConfig file 
  and that the chameleon booter does not load the one that the panel selected,
  see upper to force the bootConfig to match the one loaded by the  chameleon booter.
