- Started to deprecate former system id uuid options: now encouraging to use SMsystemid because it follows smbios options naming convention, is not as vague as SMUUID, and should belong to smbios config, not bootConfig.
  For theses reasons, SystemId from bootConfig and SMUUID from smbiosConfig aer now DEPRECATED.

- Integrated JrCs fadt patch (kept for RC5 the existing DSDT.aml  retry algo that disapeared in his patch, should be more discussed for RC6)
- Added JrCs modified convention name change to coding_standards
- Now malloc (ex. MALLOC in Asere patch) is renamed malloc(size) and is an alias 
  to safe_malloc(size, file, line) with _FILE_ and _LINE_ prerocessor definitions
- Added a new 'Rename Partition Feature', now permitting to rename partition 
  like 'System reserved' to a more meaningful name
- Added SystemID option permitting to change the System UUID to a fixed value.
- Added the PciRoot autodetection feature imported from pcefi10.5
- Added automatic "system-id" injection from dmi bios, also compatible 
  with SystemID boot option and former SMUUID from smbios,plist
- Added "system-type' automatic injection (1=Desktop) plus override possibility 
  with the new system-type option in bootConfig
- Added SMserial and SMproductname new options for smbios.plist
- Merged with asere patch, while keeping my fake_efi.c changes, and adding a new 
  stringForKey() API, also changed the DT__XXXX() set of functions 
  to handle const char * values instead of char*.
